Overview 

You need to design and implement an Email system event modeler & intrusion 
detection system in accordance with the system descriptions below. The 
implementation is to be in C, C++, Java, or Python. While there are concrete 
details on the form of the initial input, and certain inputs along the way, the 
format of intermediate data is up to each group. 

You need to provide a report in a file Report.pdf covering the various points 
through this assignment where information is required. This report should be 
broken into sections associated with the components as follows: 
‚Ä¢ Initial input. 
‚Ä¢ Activity engine and logs. 
‚Ä¢ Analysis engine. 
‚Ä¢ Alert engine. 


Initial Input 
You only need command line options at the setup phase, some user input is 
required later. 
IDS Events.txt Stats.txt Days 
Events.txt and Stats.txt define the formats and the distributions of the events 
to be modelled. Days is an integer used in the next section. 
Here goes an example Events.txt file. This file describes the events and some 
of their parameters. 

5 
Logins:D:0::2: 
Time  online:C:0:1440:2: 
Emails sent:D:0::1: 
Emails opened:D:0::1: 
Emails deteled:D:0::2:

 
The first line contains the number of events being monitored. Each subsequent 
line is of the form  

Event name:[CD]:minimum:maximum:weight: 

C and D represent continuous and discrete events respectively. Discrete events 
must take integer values and occur one at a time, continuous events don‚Äôt need 
to take an integer value and an occurrence of that event may be of any value. 
The minimum and maximum specify the allowed range for that event type 
across a day. Continuous events need to be recorded in two decimal places. The 
weights are used in the alert engine and will always be positive integers. 
The file Stats.txt contains the distributions to be modelled for the events. Here 
goes an example Stats.txt file.

Logins:4:1.5: 
Time  online:150.5:25.00: 
Emails  sent:10:3: 
Emails opened:12:4.5: 
Emails  deteled:7:2.25: 


The first line again contains the number of events being monitored. Each 
subsequent line is of the form 

Event name:mean:standard deviation: 

Your program should appropriately report events and statistics read in, as 
evidence this phase works. You should include in your report a description of: 
1. How you are going to store the events and statistics internally. 
2. Potential inconsistencies between Events.txt and Stats.txt. You should 
attempt to detect those inconsistencies. If there are inconsistencies you 
are aware of but haven‚Äôt attempted to detect them, note this in your 
report. 

Activity Engine and the Logs 
Instructions for Event Generation and Logging with the Activity Engine 

1. Starting Event Generation 
‚Ä¢ After completing the initial setup and loading the base files, start the activity 
engine to generate and log events. 
‚Ä¢ Ensure that your program provides feedback on its progress without producing 
excessive detail. 

2. Generating Consistent Statistics 
‚Ä¢ Generate events that are approximately consistent with the statistics 
specified in Stats.txt. 
‚Ä¢ Log events over the number of days specified during the initial setup of the 
IDS. 

3. Logging Options 
‚Ä¢ You may choose to store the events in separate files for each day or in a single 
log file, according to your preference. This collection of events will serve as 
baseline data for the system. 

4. Reporting Requirements 
Include the following descriptions in your report: 
‚Ä¢ Event Generation Process: 
Explain how events are generated to align approximately with the specified 
distribution in Stats.txt. Describe any distinctions between handling discrete 
and continuous events. 
‚Ä¢ Log File Structure: 
‚Ä¢ Specify the name and format of the log file and justify your choice of format. 
‚Ä¢ Ensure the log file is human-readable, as it will be used for subsequent parts 
of the program. 


Analysis Engine 
Your program should indicate when event generation is complete and when it is 
starting the analysis phase. At this point, you will measure the baseline data for each 
event and calculate the associated statistics. 

1. Data Processing and Storage: 
‚Ä¢ Compute daily totals for each event and save them in a data file. 
‚Ä¢ Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each event based on this 
baseline data. 
‚Ä¢ Provide progress updates as appropriate. 

2. Handling Incomplete Data Consistency: 
‚Ä¢ If data generation does not fully match a given distribution, the analysis engine 
can still read from and report on the log file. 

3. Reporting Requirements: 
‚Ä¢ Include in your report the name and format of the file that stores daily totals 
and statistical data for each event. 


Alert Engine 
Consistency Check and Intrusion Detection Workflow 

1. Overview of the Alert Engine 
The alert engine monitors consistency between "live data" and baseline statistics to 
detect potential anomalies. This process consists of three main phases: input 
setup, data generation, and anomaly detection. 

2. Input Setup 
‚Ä¢ Prompt the user to select a file containing new statistics. This file will follow the 
same format as the previously used Stats.txt but may include different 
parameters for specific events. 
‚Ä¢ Request the number of days for which to generate activity data. 

3. Data Generation 
‚Ä¢ Use the activity engine to simulate and produce event data for the specified 
number of days. 
‚Ä¢ Run the analysis engine to calculate daily totals based on the simulated data, 
which will serve as input for alert detection. 

4. Anomaly Detection Process 
‚Ä¢ For each day, calculate an anomaly counter by following these steps: 
i. Compute Standard Deviation: For each event, determine how many 
standard deviations the daily event value deviates from its baseline mean, 
which was calculated from previous data. 
ii. Apply Event Weights: Multiply each deviation by its assigned weight, as 
specified in Events.txt. 
iii. Sum Deviations: Add up all weighted deviations to obtain the total 
anomaly counter for the day.

 
5. Example of Anomaly Calculation 
‚Ä¢ Suppose the baseline mean for daily logins is 4, with a standard deviation of 
1.5. 
‚Ä¢ On a particular day, there is only 1 login, which is 2 standard deviations below 
the mean. 
‚Ä¢ If the login event weight is 2, then this event contributes 2√ó2 = 42 to the 
anomaly counter. 


6. Threshold Comparison and Reporting 
‚Ä¢ Threshold Calculation: Set the threshold for detecting an anomaly as 
2 √ó(ùë†ùë¢ùëö ùëúùëì ùë§ùëíùëñùëî‚Ñéùë°ùë†), where weights are defined in Events.txt. 
‚Ä¢ Daily Reporting: For each day: 
‚ñ™ Output the threshold value and the calculated anomaly counter. 
‚ñ™ State whether the day is "okay" or "flagged" as an alert, based on whether 
the anomaly counter meets or exceeds the threshold. 


7. Repeating the Process 
‚Ä¢ Once all days are processed, return to the beginning of this phase so the user 
can load another statistics file and specify a new number of days for analysis. 
‚Ä¢ Provide an option to quit.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open up a terminal and run the program by typing the following into the command line:

python3 IDS.py Events.txt Stats.txt <<DAYS>>

Do change the path if necessary: cd Desktop/<Folder name>

For the <<Days>> is self-defined

Ensure the Events.txt and Stats.txt are in the same folder as IDS.py and run this for the initial input.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the above has done running, input a new Stats.txt file. If you have a new Stat.txt, you may use yours or use the provided file (Stats2.txt).

For the <<Days>> is self-defined


Enter the new Stats.txt file (or 'q' to quit): Stats2.txt
Enter the number of days for the new stats file: <<DAYS>>

You can continue running for subsequent new Stats.txt

*Note if you choose to rerun the whole program, please delete all the generated txt files (Baseline.txt, log1, etc....)
